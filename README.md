# Welcome to My Convex Optimization
***

## Task
The task was about finding optimal solutions for given functions in different ways, including Gradient Descent, Simplex, Bisection, Newton Raphson methods.

## Description
I solved the problem using the hints given in the task and I googled the background information about the methods so that I can understand the logic behind them. 

## Installation
To see the code working one can just enter python my_convex_optimization.py in the terminal

## Usage
By doing the steps above one can see the results each method gives. There are also some comments included to understand the parameters included in the code.

### The Core Team
I have done the task by myself since at that time it seemed that noone was looking for a partner.
